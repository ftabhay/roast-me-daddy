### Project Description
RoastMeDaddy is an AI-powered app that delivers personalized, escalating roasts through chat, quizzes, and profile analysis. Built with Next.js and powered by the Gemini API, it offers features like GitHub-based developer roasts, potential fashion critiques, and even typing-test insults.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
These days, people walk around like their LinkedIn bio is a personality and their GitHub commits deserve a Nobel Prize. Filters and motivational quotes have let egos run wild, and no one dares to deliver a reality check. From self-proclaimed fashion icons to ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù typists, unchecked confidence has become a global epidemic.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
RoastMeDaddy swoops in as the ultimate ego-popping machine, armed with AI-powered wit to deliver roasts sharper than a fresh razor. Whether it‚Äôs dismantling your overblown LinkedIn swagger, dragging your GitHub profile through the mud, or mocking your ‚Äúunique‚Äù fashion sense, it serves personalized burns that escalate with every interaction. Built with Next.js and powered by the Gemini API, it ensures every insult lands fast, hard, and hilariously.

Install dependencies: ```bash npm install ```
Set up Environment Variables: Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and add your API keys: ``` GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" # Optional, for enhanced GitHub roasts ```
You can get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) can be generated in your GitHub settings (Developer settings > Personal access tokens). It's optional; the app will fall back to basic GitHub data without it.
